Husband / Father / Web Developer / Lover of emojis :octopus:

I'm currently a web developer at [VAS](http://www.vas.com) in Central California working mainly in Ruby/Rails.

Outside of spending time with my wife and two boys I mostly [play video games](http://live.xbox.com/Profile?Gamertag=MaRsHiN), take some decent pictures, and try to find problems for solutions I've come across.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/marceloalves), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/celo_fett), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/celo_fett)
